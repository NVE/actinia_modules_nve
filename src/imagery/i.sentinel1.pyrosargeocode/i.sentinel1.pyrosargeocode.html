<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.sentinel1.pyrosargeocode</em> geocodes Sentinel-1 imagery on a user defined Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
<b>elevation</b> using ESA SNAP Sentinel-1 Tool Box (S1TBX) through the pyrosar library developed by (XXXXXXXXXXX).
Sentinel-1 images will be projected to the Coordinate reference systems (CRS) of the input DEM, wich is assumed to
match the CRS of the current LOCATION. In that process, results will be aligned with and resampled to the pixels
in the input DEM.

If the <b>f-flag</b> is set, a precise orbit file is fetched from ESAs web service if available (recommended).
Note that there is usually a several days time lag after sensing time before these files are made available. If
precise orbit files for the given scene are not available, the process will proceeed and give a warning.

<p>
<b>input</b> can be a single Sentinel-1 SAFE file (also in zipped format), a comma separated list of Sentinel-1
files or a text file with a list of Sentinel-1 files to geocode. Geocoded images are stored in GeoTIFF format
in the <b>output_directory</b> with file names following the naming convention in pyroSAR. Resulting files are
then either imported into the GRASS GIS database <em>r.in.gdal</em> or linked  using <em>r.external</em>, if
the <b>l-flag</b>, <b>m-flag</b>, or <b>r-flag</b> are given.

<p>
If only a specifc extent of the Sentinel-1 images is supposed to be geocoded, the user can define
the Area of Interest <b>aoi</b> in form of a GeoJSON with a single geometry.

<p>
In the <b>nprocs</b> option, users can specify the number of parallel process to run. If more than one
Sentinel-1 scene is given in the <b>input</n> option, <b>nprocs</b> number of scenes will be processed in
parallel. Otherwise, <b>nprocs</b> defines the number of cores available to the graph processing tool (gpt)
in ESA SNAP. As geocoding is quite memory demanding, the user has to account for the amount of memory made
available to ESA SNAP / gpt when activating parallel processing with <b>nprocs</b> > 1.

<p>
Currently, only geocoding of Sentinel-1 GRD imagery in IW <b>mode</b> and with VV or VH <b>polarization</b>
is supported.

For more information on the pyroSAR processing chain, lease consult the pyroSAR manual, especially the
documentation for processing with ESA SNAP.

<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<em>i.sentinel1.pyrosargeocode</em> requires ESA SNAP to be installed with the Graph Processing tool
(gpt) available on PATH. In addition, the pyroSAR Python libraries is required which can be installed
from pypi with: pip install pyroSAR
